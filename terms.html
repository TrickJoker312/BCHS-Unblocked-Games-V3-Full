					MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and
					disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or
					service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in
					small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
					individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless
					otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
					English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and
					to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in
					interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
					unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under
					the Terms.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>
					Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
					the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
					basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to
					the Company should be sent to: US. After the Notice is received, you and
					the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If
					you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
					(30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
					arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any
					party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
					has determined the amount of the award to which either party is
					entitled.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated
					through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative
					dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this
					section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree
					to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider
					shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such
					rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration
					Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by
					calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted
					by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total
					amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
					$10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
					arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or
					disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
					Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
					determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a
					location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside
					of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you
					reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties
					reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
					judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
					court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award
					that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
					you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the
					greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs
					and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal
					share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong>
					If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be
					conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
					submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating
					the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal
					appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
					parties.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration,
					the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the
					statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
					Rules for the pertinent claim.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated,
					the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the
					Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters
					or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have
					the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. 
					The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and
					to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
					under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator
					shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the
					essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  The
					arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
					that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator
					is final and binding upon you and the Company.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR
					CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
					FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and
					disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
					Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
					efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are
					subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation
					should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court
					in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
					AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that
					the dispute be resolved by a judge.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and
					disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be
					arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis,
					and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
					litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or
					user.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration
					proceeding shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to
					maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This
					paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law
					any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
					arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration
					Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a
					court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall
					be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
					Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and
					limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the
					party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive
					or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will
					survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either
					you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing,
					either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
					federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. 
					A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
					rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the
					foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and
					Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s
					patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to
					this Arbitration Agreement.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits
					the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to
					the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands
					County, California, for such purposes.
				</p>

				<p class="legal-body">
					The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject
					to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to
					export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S.

					data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

					you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send
					us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates
					with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive

					all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
					communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any
					legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in
					a hard copy writing.

				<p class="legal-body">
					<strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire
					agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure
					to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not
					operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in
					these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
					effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation". If
					any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
					other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or
					unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and
					enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship
					to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an
					agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and
					obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or
					otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent,
					and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in
					violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely
					assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms
					shall be binding upon assignees.
